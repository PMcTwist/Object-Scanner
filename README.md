# 3D Scanner

This project is a capstone for UWindsors mechatronics program. We wanted to kick it up a notch and build a custom UI for PC integration as well as a stand alone touch ui driven by raspberry pi. 
The hardware of the project is driven by Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi.

## Basic Design

The basic concept is an x, y, z measurement taken from a rotating platform with a threaded rod with a distance sensor on it. Pretty simple in concept.

## Implemenatation

We started out with a few Nema17 motors, TF-Luna LiDAR sensor, and an arduino.

From there a basic UI was made with PyQt5 and QtDesigner.

Including a CNC shield board and A4988 drivers to drive the motors allowed for microstepping for a better resolution of scan.

To take it over the top, the addition of a raspberry pi and touch screen for serial control of the scanner and real time model rendering.

Next, updating the CAD to refelct the real components and the measurments we need for a frame.

## Setup

Users can extract the provided exe (For Windows) in releases or use the Pi-HMI directly on the device. Linux users can use the python files directly or setup the same system service we called. 

The scanner has two modes of operation. <br/>
   1 - Pi-HMI <br/>
   2 - USB Interface
